Al Nakheel is a filter-based application for Android and iPhone designed for farm owners, suppliers, consumers, and delivery companies. 
This application connects four parts within a single application with a dedicated admin interface for managing and monitoring operations and issuing reports. 
The first part is for consumers, where products can be browsed and searched, and they are divided into separate tabs according to their section, adding to the basket, determining the quantity, and choosing the payment method. 
The second part is for suppliers. After creating a supplier account, the supplier displays the products he wants to sell, with his own control panel to know sales, total revenues, etc. 
The third section is for delivery men, where they can create an account. The supplier can choose the delivery company or delivery man, then deliver the goods to him and send the location and details of the shipment. Once the delivery man is chosen, the delivery man delivers the shipment to its destination, where he obtains all the necessary information.
Section Four: Farm owners or farmers display their products or order products specific to farmers.
This application facilitates operations, as well as sales, displaying products, and following statistics. 
The application is connected to Firebase databases to save data in real time, which gives speed, control and accuracy, in addition to a barcode to verify, for example, shipment deliveries and follow them via maps. 
It also has many features, whether for learning or actual use.
Subsequent updates were to add another language, as the application is in Arabic.
